We replicated three studies in this work, i.e., Issue Localization (ICSE'12), Duplicate Detection (ASE'11), Fix-time Prediction (CSMR'12).

*The scripts that we used in the work include many operations about Mysql database. The users need to modify the configuration to run the scripts.


[Issue Localization]

*The script/program is downloaded from
storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/bugcenter/BugLocator.zip

*The source files of Eclipse v3.1 is downloaded from
archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.1.zip

*When running the script/program, the alpha factor is set to 0


[Duplicate Detection]
*The script/program is downloaded from
www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/dbrd-ase11.tar

*The datasets of the original paper are downloaded from
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/large-eclipse.txt.tar.bz2
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/large-mozilla.txt.tar.bz2

*When running the script/program, the config file is full-textual-full-categorial.cfg

*To run the script/program, the iteration number is set to 5


[Fix-time Prediction]

*The ML tool is Weka v3.8.1.
