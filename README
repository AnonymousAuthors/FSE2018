We replicated three studies in this work, i.e., Issue Localization (ICSE'12), Duplicate Detection (ASE'11), Fix-time Prediction (CSMR'12).

*The scripts that we used in the work include many operations about Mysql database. The users need to modify the configuration to run the scripts.


[Issue Localization]

[Download]

*The script/program and dataset is downloaded from
storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/bugcenter/BugLocator.zip

*The source files of Eclipse v3.1 is downloaded from
archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/R-3.1-200506271435/eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-3.1.zip

[Description]
BugLocator.zip contains BugLocator.jar and data/EclipseBugRepository.xml, which are needed in this replication experiment. 
But it does not contain the source files of Eclipse, so you have to download the source files by yourself. 
According to the original paper, the version of Eclipse is 3.1, and the available link is provided above.

According to the issue id (i.e., bug id) recorded in data/EclipseBugRepository and Eclipse2011 (a MySql dump of Eclipse, the available link is provided above), we searched initial Summary for each issue to compose EclipseBugRepository_initial.xml

So far, the input data of BugLocator.jar is ready.
*EclipseBugRepository_initial.xml (or EclipseBugRepository_initial.xml)
*Eclipse v3.1 source files

*When running the script/program, the alpha factor is set to 0
The detailed command is 
java -jar BugLocator.jar -b <path of EclipseBugRepository_initial.xml> -s <path of Eclipse source files folder> -a 0 -o <path of output file>


[Duplicate Detection]
*The script/program is downloaded from
www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/dbrd-ase11.tar

*The datasets of the original paper are downloaded from
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/large-eclipse.txt.tar.bz2
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~specmine/suncn/ase11/large-mozilla.txt.tar.bz2

*When running the script/program, the config file is full-textual-full-categorial.cfg

*To run the script/program, the iteration number is set to 5


[Fix-time Prediction]

*The ML tool is Weka v3.8.1.
